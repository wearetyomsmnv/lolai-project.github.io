## 📋 Content Guidelines

### Quality Standards

- **Accuracy**: All information must be verified and accurate
- **References**: Include credible sources and documentation
- **Completeness**: Cover all template sections thoroughly
- **Clarity**: Write clearly and concisely

### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- Use correct technique IDs (e.g., T1059, T1106)
- Verify techniques at [attack.mitre.org](https://attack.mitre.org/)
- Include sub-techniques when relevant (e.g., T1059.001)

### Code Examples

```python
# ✅ Good: Clear, realistic, educational
def exploit_example():
    # This demonstrates the vulnerability
    os.system('malicious_command')

# ❌ Bad: Working exploit code for 0-days
# Don't include actual exploit code
```

### Sensitive Information

**DO NOT include:**
- Working 0-day exploits
- Real credentials or API keys
- Specific victim information
- Techniques for active campaigns

**DO include:**
- Educational examples
- Detection methods
- Mitigation strategies
- Public vulnerability information

## 🎯 Categories

Use these standard categories:

- **Code Assistant**: IDE integrations, code completion tools
- **Autonomous Agent**: Self-directed AI agents
- **Security Tool**: AI-powered security applications
- **System Automation**: RPA and automation tools
- **Research Assistant**: Research and analysis tools
- **Creative Tool**: Content generation and creative applications

## 🔍 Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**
   - YAML front matter validation
   - Markdown linting
   - Link checking

2. **Manual Review**
   - Technical accuracy
   - Content completeness
